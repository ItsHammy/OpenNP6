    Woo here we go.
    I am a McDonald's Employee. I am not using any resources from work apart from my own knowledge of the operating system.
    This project is not affiliated with McDonald's Restaurants Limited or any of its affiliates, subsideries, or otherwise. This is a personal project and is not intended for commercial use.
    I am currently taking donation's for this project, however if MRL requests me to take this down, I will do so immediately, or I will switch the donation button to a RMHC link if they would prefer.

    Restaurant Managers/Ops Consultants/Owner Operators: If you would like to use this for your store, please contact me, I would be happy to help you set it up or make minor modifications to the software.

    *** Overall this is a personal project to improve my coding skills. ***

    Contact me:

    Internally, you know how to find my employee number.
