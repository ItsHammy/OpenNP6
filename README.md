# OpenNP6
OpenNP6 is a planned, open source, version of the NP6 software for basic training/practice for McDonald's Employees. I am building it to match the NZ version first, however am happy to customise region specific controls in the future. Once there is a somewhat useable version, you will see it on my website.
