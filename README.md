# OpenNP6
OpenNP6 is a planned, open source, version of the NP6 software for basic training/practice for McDonald's Employees. I am building it to match the NZ version first, however am happy to customise region specific controls in the future. Once there is a somewhat useable version, you will see it on my website.

## Resource Information
I was lucky enough to find a leak of the old MeTime AU training version and borrow some images from there, other POS images are my own.
